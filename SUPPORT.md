### Before Asking for Help

To get the best help quickly, please:

1. **Search existing resources**
   - Check [FAQ](docs/user-guide/FAQ.md)
   - Search [closed issues](https://github.com/Thomas-Heisig/4D-Neural-Cognition/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

3. **Create a minimal example**
   - Simplify your code to the smallest example that shows the problem
   - Remove unnecessary details
   - Include sample data if needed

### How to Ask Good Questions

Good questions get better answers. Please:

- **Be specific**: "Why does my simulation crash?" → "Simulation crashes with MemoryError after 10,000 steps when using density=0.5"
- **Show what you tried**: Include code snippets and error messages
- **Describe expected behavior**: "I expected X, but got Y instead"
- **Be respectful**: Remember that maintainers are volunteers

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

If you've found a bug:

1. **Check if it's already known**: See [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md)
2. **Verify it's reproducible**: Can you make it happen consistently?
3. **Create a bug report**: Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/Thomas-Heisig/4D-Neural-Cognition/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Include:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
- Error messages and logs
- Screenshots (if UI-related)

## 💡 Feature Requests

Have an idea for a new feature?

1. **Check the roadmap**: See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for planned features
2. **Search existing requests**: Someone may have already suggested it
3. **Create a feature request**: Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/Thomas-Heisig/4D-Neural-Cognition/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

Include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case: What problem does it solve?
